# Note Taker

<h4>Designed and coded by <a href="https://github.com/fizzaaz">FIZZA ZAIDI</a></h4>

This project was designed as a homework assignment for UT Austin coding bootcamp. This application emphasizes the use of express framework to create an node application. The challenge is to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write, save and delete notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

## Getting Started
üîçThis entire application is deployed to Heroku. To get this project up and running, you can follow the deployment link. Or, clone the repository from GitHub to use this as a template.

# Technology :

**1. [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)** :

* Web Applications : Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

* APIs : With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware, creating a robust API is quick and easy.

* Performance : Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features.

**2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** : 

* Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. 

* A Node.js app is run in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. 

* Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking.

**3. [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)** : Creates random unique id's.

# Usage :

* Clone this repository to use this application on local machine.

* To install necessary dependencies, run the following command :

```
npm i
```

* The application will be invoked with the following command: This will start localhost server on PORT 3001.

```
node server.js
```

* Open browser and type `http://localhost:3001/` to run this application on your local machine.

# Features :

1. Used 'Express.js' to build server

2. Used 'fs(File System)' module to read and write from 'db.json' file.

3. Used [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) npm package to give unique id to each note.

4. Application is deployed on [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) : Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps.

# User Requirements
